				<h2>Happy Ramadan Kareem</h2>
				<p>The holy month Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and a great opportunity for all Muslims to purify their mind, body, heart and soul by fasting and praying to Almighty Allah. Ramadan is not only for fasting but also all Muslims should dedicate themselves to self-sacrifice like abstain from taking drink or food and physical needs, asking forgiveness for their wrongdoings and devoting themselves to Allah.</p>

				<p>May the blessed month of Ramadan bring you peace and prosperity. May your prayers be answered. Ramadan Kareem!</p>
